# Hostman
I've always felt like the hosts file was a neglected gem in networking. I'm sure many people have used it, but what about using it to its full potential? For but one example, it can be used as a DNS sinkhole. If there are hosts or domains that you would rather not connect to, redirect traffic to your loopback address.
